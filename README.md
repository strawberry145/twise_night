1. Purpose

Our game is designed to raise awareness about the urgency of global warming, with a special focus on the dramatic climate changes happening in Tunisia. We want to inspire players to be part of the solution by highlighting two key actions:

1.	Improving energy efficiency – It’s not just about using less energy, but making sure it’s distributed wisely across different applications.
2.	Expanding renewable energy – By shifting away from fossil fuels, we can reduce carbon emissions and build cleaner, more sustainable cities.

Through engaging gameplay, we hope to spark curiosity, encourage learning, and empower players to take meaningful action. Our goal is to make energy conservation a habit that lasts, helping create a better future for everyone

2. Target Audience
Our target audience is middle and secondary school students. They have lived under the influence of global warming since birth and will continue to face drastic climate changes as they grow older. While students learn about the problems of global warming and climate change at school, most of the education focuses on small actions they can take in their daily lives.

Our game, however, offers students the chance to think about energy from a more long-term perspective by allowing them to create energy-saving or distribution plans at the city level. Since the game also incorporates considerations that are part of real-world city planning and operations, students can engage with discussions on environmental protection that are happening in society today. Another important aspect of environmental protection is the economic issue. By providing students with the experience of both saving energy and managing finances, we aim to help them develop more multifaceted thinking.


3. Approach
We developed a strategy game where the player will become the mayor of a city in Tunisia. To emphasize that a different approach needs to be considered for each city, we prepared as an options Sousse . The player should plan and propose an energy use strategy as a mayor.

At the same time, they must manage the money level carefully to ensure it doesn't fall below the required threshold. Ultimately, the player must achieve the target for both the energy and money levels to pass the game. Through these elements, we aim to convey that environmental and economic factors need to be considered together in the long term.

In the bonus quiz, players are presented with questions based on articles from NASA on scientific and environmental knowledge.

Once a player clears one city, they are encouraged to move on to the next. The ultimate goal is to get players to think about energy efficiency on a national scale in Tunisia
5. Use of Artificial Intelligence
We used ChatGPT to draft game dialogues and educational content, while DALL-E was utilized to generate visual assets such as character designs, maps, and icons. The combination of these AI tools allowed us to create a rich and engaging environment for the players.
